What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Running git init initializes a repository which creates a .git directory with files needed to create commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is just the area where we place the files to be commited. Working directory is the directory where all files are stored

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

While files are in the staging area they can be compared with the working directory and see the differences between them before they are commited

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches are helpful when we want to make changes to the file but we are not sure if they are going to work or not, this way the master branch doesn't get modified.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They allow you to see all the branches created and their respective commits.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The result of merging two branches together is that it creates one "final" result with the two branches combined. The diagram helps visualizing all the different branches and possible branches that may become unreachable.
