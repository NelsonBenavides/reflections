When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    So that other people can collaborate with the project and add their changes to it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Since in GitHub changes may be commited by different contributors, you may want to make sure all changes are correct before pulling to local repository...

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks allow you to make a copy of someone else's repository directly on the Github servers without pulling down the code to the local machine first.
    Clones are repository copies made either locally or from Github to local
    Branches can be created either locally or on Github servers.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    When collaborators make changes to the remote, having a local copy allows you to review the changes before integrating then into the copy of the project, resolving possible conflicts.
